# Third-party components

This project uses original application code with the following dependencies:

- Microsoft .NET 10 / WPF: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and https://github.com/dotnet/wpf (MIT and included third-party notices in the upstream distributions).
- Microsoft.Web.WebView2 1.0.4258.31: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2/1.0.4258.31 (Microsoft WebView2 SDK license applies).
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime: installed separately under Microsoft's runtime license. https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/

The project is unaffiliated with Pixiv. Pixiv owns its service, logos and website content; artwork rights belong to their respective creators.

Version 1.0.1 bundles the user-supplied icon image and theme wallpaper as UI assets. These images retain their creators' rights. The wallpaper's visible attribution is @cloneko.oo. The original images and their visible credit are preserved; the application dependency licenses do not grant artwork rights.
